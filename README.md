# Hospital-Operations-Performance-Analytics
This project analyzes real-world hospital operational challenges by building a full data pipeline from raw datasets to a fully interactive Power BI dashboard.
## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hospital patient data to extract actionable insights for healthcare operations. Using Python, Pandas, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, the analysis includes:

- Cleaning and preprocessing patient data
- Calculating key metrics such as average length of stay (LOS) and readmission rates
- Visualizing department-wise trends and patterns
- Creating reproducible Jupyter notebooks and modular scripts

The goal is to demonstrate practical data analysis skills in healthcare, while presenting the results in a clean, professional, and easily interpretable format. This project can serve as a portfolio piece for recruiters or collaborators interested in healthcare data analytics.
